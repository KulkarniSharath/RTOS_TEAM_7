## What is Queues?

*A queue in a real-time operating system (RTOS) is a kernel object that is capable of passing information between tasks without incurring overwrites from other tasks or entering into a race condition. A queue is a first in, first out (FIFO) system where items are removed from the queue once read.

## What is CMSIS-RTOS?

* The CMSIS-RTOS is a common API for Real-Time operating systems. It provides a standardized programming interface that is portable to many RTOS and enables therefore software templates, middleware, libraries, and other components that can work across supported the RTOS systems.
